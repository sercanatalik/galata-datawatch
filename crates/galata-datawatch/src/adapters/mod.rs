//! Which adapter a venue name means.
//!
//! **This is the only module in the crate that names a venue**, which is what
//! `scripts/check-venue-boundary.sh` keeps honest: everything above the seam
//! holds a `dyn Adapter` and cannot tell two venues apart.
//!
//! A venue name appearing elsewhere is a branch that will be wrong for the next
//! venue, and it will be wrong quietly.
